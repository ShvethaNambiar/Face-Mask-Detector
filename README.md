# Face-Mask-Detector
## Using Keras, OpenCV, Python
Real-time face mask detection using Python. This project was done as a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation - Graduate Rotational Internship Program in July 2021.
I have made a real-time face mask detector, that detects a person is wearing a face mask or not.
## IDE used
Jupyter notebook using TensorFlow backend
## Libraries
1. Keras - for developing and evaluating deep learning models and image processing
2. Sklearn - for machine learning and statistical modeling
3. Numpy - working with arrays
4. cv2 - real time image processing
5. imutils - image processing
